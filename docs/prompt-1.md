please meticulously review and analyze @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , @PHASE_1_SUBPLAN.md , @PHASE_2_SUBPLAN.md and @status.md to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project and its codebase design and architecture. Next systematically and meticulously validate your deep understanding against the actual codebase to check where we are with respect to the master plan and sub-plans.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please save/stage your deep understanding of the current project's state as a markdown file named `My_Deep_Understanding.md` in the project root so that you can always refer to it later for aligning with the goals and objectives. Next, please meticulously plan and then proceed with the remaining tasks in Phase 2 plan @PHASE_2_SUBPLAN.md . Always to follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology to ensure production-ready code quality after completing each phase.
