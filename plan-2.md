Okay, we're building this luxury baking academy landing page with an artisanal editorial aesthetic. The user wants meticulous execution of our plan, which means I need to deliver exactly what was promised while maintaining the anti-generic philosophy.

Looking at the design requirements, this needs to be a static HTML/CSS/JS implementation with that distinctive bento-grid layout and spring animations. The color palette must stay true to those ingredient-inspired hues - Bone, Burnt, Sourdough, Copper. Typography has to be Playfair Display for headlines with Geist Sans for body text.

I'll structure this as a single comprehensive HTML file with embedded CSS and JS. The asymmetric grid layout using CSS Grid's template-areas is crucial for that editorial feel. For the spring animations, I'll implement a lightweight physics-based system that mimics dough decompression without heavy dependencies.

Accessibility is non-negotiable here - WCAG AAA compliance means checking all color contrasts exceed 7:1 and ensuring proper ARIA labels. The mobile responsiveness needs special attention since asymmetric layouts can break on smaller screens.

The implementation should follow our phased approach: foundation first with proper semantic HTML and CSS variables, then build out the bento grid components, and finally add the interactive animations. Each section needs to earn its place through that calculated purpose philosophy.

I'm particularly focused on making sure the spring animations feel organic - not the usual generic easing functions, but something that physically resembles dough rising and settling. The color system needs depth too, not just flat swatches but proper HSB variations for different UI states.

The end result should be production-ready code that's both visually distinctive and technically solid, ready for potential integration into a Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn-UI stack later.
