## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering any solution:
- [ ] Solution meets all stated requirements
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing has been implemented
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Potential edge cases have been considered
- [ ] Long-term maintenance implications have been evaluated

## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

# PART 1: V4 FUNDAMENTALS & ARCHITECTURE

## 1.1 The CSS-First Paradigm Shift

Tailwind CSS v4.0 represents a fundamental transformation from JavaScript-based configuration to native CSS theming. This architectural change aligns with modern CSS capabilities while delivering substantial performance improvements.

### The Mental Model Transformation

**v3.4 Configuration (Legacy)**
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          500: '#3B82F6',
          600: '#2563EB'
        }
      },
      fontFamily: {
        display: ['Inter', 'sans-serif']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**v4.0 Configuration (CSS-First)**
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-brand-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);
  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

### Critical Understanding Points

The v4.0 approach introduces several paradigm shifts that must be understood:

**Theme Variables as Native CSS Custom Properties**: Unlike v3 where theme values were compiled into utility classes, v4 exposes theme variables as native CSS custom properties. This means utilities like `bg-brand-500` actually reference `var(--color-brand-500)` in the generated CSS.

**Color Space Migration to OKLCH**: v4 defaults to OKLCH color space, which provides better gamut coverage and perceptual uniformity compared to RGB. While hex values still work, OKLCH is preferred for design system tokens.

**Lightning CSS Compilation**: v4 uses Lightning CSS (written in Rust) for compilation, delivering 3.78x faster full builds and 8.8x faster incremental rebuilds compared to v3.

**Zero-Configuration Content Detection**: By default, v4 automatically detects content files without requiring explicit `@source` directives, though explicit configuration remains available for monorepo scenarios.

### Browser Requirements

Tailwind CSS v4.0 requires modern browsers that support modern CSS features:

- Safari 16.4+
- Chrome 111+
- Firefox 128+

Projects requiring older browser support **must remain on v3.4** or implement fallback strategies.

---

## 1.2 Installation & Build Tool Configuration

### Package Dependencies

**Remove v3 Dependencies**
```bash
npm uninstall tailwindcss postcss-import autoprefixer
```

**Install v4 Dependencies**
```bash
# For PostCSS users
npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/postcss

# For Vite users (RECOMMENDED - superior performance)
npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/vite
```

### PostCSS Configuration (Legacy Approach)

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
export default {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
```

### Vite Configuration (Recommended)

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss()],
});
```

The Vite plugin is recommended over PostCSS because it leverages Lightning CSS directly, eliminating the PostCSS plugin chain overhead.

### CSS Import Directive Migration

**v3.4 Approach (Three Directives)**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**v4.0 Approach (Single Import)**
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

The single import replaces all three v3 directives. Import bundling is built-in, eliminating the need for `postcss-import`. Automatic vendor prefixing is handled by Lightning CSS.

---

## 1.3 Theme Configuration & Customization

### @theme Directive Structure

The `@theme` directive defines design tokens that automatically generate corresponding utilities:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  /* Typography */
  --font-sans: "Inter", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "Inter", sans-serif;
  
  /* Colors - OKLCH color space */
  --color-brand-50: oklch(0.99 0.01 117.33);
  --color-brand-100: oklch(0.97 0.02 117.33);
  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-brand-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);
  --color-brand-900: oklch(0.21 0.04 118.34);
  
  /* Spacing Scale */
  --spacing-18: 4.5rem;
  --spacing-88: 22rem;
  
  /* Custom Breakpoints */
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
  
  /* Animation */
  --animate-spin: spin 1s linear infinite;
  
  @keyframes spin {
    to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
  }
}
```

### Theme Variable Access

Variables defined in `@theme` are accessible anywhere in CSS:

```css
/* Direct CSS variable usage */
.card {
  background-color: var(--color-brand-500);
  padding: var(--spacing-4);
  font-family: var(--font-display);
}

/* In arbitrary values */
.btn {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, var(--color-brand-500), var(--color-brand-600));
}
```

### Content Detection & @source Directive

v4.0 uses automatic content detection by default:

```css
/* Automatic detection - no configuration needed */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* Explicit inclusion for non-standard paths */
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib";
@source "../../legacy-components";
@source "../components/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}";
```

### JavaScript Config Backward Compatibility

For projects transitioning gradually, v4 can load a legacy `tailwind.config.js`:

```css
@config "../../tailwind.config.js";
@import "tailwindcss";
```

**Not Supported in v4**:
- `corePlugins` option
- `safelist` option (use `@source inline()` instead)
- `separator` option

# PART 2: MIGRATION PLAYBOOK (v3.4 → v4.0)

## 2.1 Utility Class Breaking Changes

### Removed Deprecated Utilities

These utilities must be migrated as they cause build failures in v4:

| **Removed v3 Utility** | **v4 Replacement** | **Migration Pattern** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `bg-opacity-*` | `bg-black/50` | Opacity modifiers |
| `text-opacity-*` | `text-black/50` | Opacity modifiers |
| `border-opacity-*` | `border-black/50` | Opacity modifiers |
| `ring-opacity-*` | `ring-black/50` | Opacity modifiers |
| `placeholder-opacity-*` | `placeholder-black/50` | Opacity modifiers |
| `flex-shrink-*` | `shrink-*` | Direct rename |
| `flex-grow-*` | `grow-*` | Direct rename |
| `overflow-ellipsis` | `text-ellipsis` | Direct rename |
| `decoration-slice` | `box-decoration-slice` | Direct rename |
| `decoration-clone` | `box-decoration-clone` | Direct rename |

**Migration Example**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-opacity-50 text-white text-opacity-80">
  Content
</div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) -->
<div class="bg-red-500/50 text-white/80">
  Content
</div>
```

### Renamed Utilities for Consistency

v4 introduces explicit naming scales for several utility categories:

| **v3 Utility** | **v4 Utility** | **Reason** |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| `shadow-sm` | `shadow-xs` | Explicit scale |
| `shadow` | `shadow-sm` | Named values |
| `shadow-md` | `shadow-md` | Unchanged |
| `shadow-lg` | `shadow-lg` | Unchanged |
| `shadow-xl` | `shadow-xl` | Unchanged |
| `drop-shadow-sm` | `drop-shadow-xs` | Consistency |
| `drop-shadow` | `drop-shadow-sm` | Consistency |
| `blur-sm` | `blur-xs` | Explicit scale |
| `blur` | `blur-sm` | Named values |
| `blur-md` | `blur-md` | Unchanged |
| `blur-lg` | `blur-lg` | Unchanged |
| `rounded-sm` | `rounded-xs` | Explicit scale |
| `rounded` | `rounded-sm` | Named values |
| `outline-none` | `outline-hidden` | Semantic clarity |
| `ring` | `ring-3` | Explicit width |

**Migration Example**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<input class="shadow rounded outline-none focus:ring" />

<!-- AFTER (v4) -->
<input class="shadow-sm rounded-sm outline-hidden focus:ring-3" />
```

### Gradient Utilities - Major Renaming

The `bg-gradient-*` utilities are renamed to support new gradient types:

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-blue-500"></div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) -->
<div class="bg-linear-to-r from-red-500 to-blue-500"></div>
```

**New Gradient Types Available in v4**:
- `bg-linear-*` - Linear gradients
- `bg-conic-*` - Conic gradients
- `bg-radial-*` - Radial gradients
- `bg-linear-45` - Angle-based gradients

**Gradient Interpolation Modifiers**:
```html
<div class="bg-linear-to-r/oklch from-red-600 to-blue-600"></div>
<div class="bg-conic/[in_hsl_longer_hue] from-red-600 to-red-600"></div>
```

**Important: Gradient Persistence Behavior Changed**
```html
<!-- v3: to-yellow-400 would reset to transparent in dark mode -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-yellow-400 dark:from-blue-500"></div>

<!-- v4: Gradients persist - use explicit reset -->
<div class="bg-linear-to-r from-red-500 via-orange-400 to-yellow-400 
     dark:via-none dark:from-blue-500 dark:to-teal-400"></div>
```

### Outline & Ring Utilities Changes

**Outline Behavior**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - Required explicit width and style -->
<input class="outline outline-2 outline-slate-400" />

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Defaults to 1px, auto-solid style -->
<input class="outline-2 outline-slate-400" />
```

**Ring Width & Color**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - ring = 3px, default blue-500 -->
<button class="focus:ring">Submit</button>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - ring-3 = 3px, currentColor default -->
<button class="focus:ring-3 focus:ring-blue-500">Submit</button>
```

**Compatibility Override** (for gradual migration):
```css
@theme {
  --default-ring-width: 3px;
  --default-ring-color: var(--color-blue-500);
}
```

### Border & Divide Color Changes

**Default Color Migration**: `gray-200` → `currentColor`

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - Implicit gray-200 -->
<div class="border px-2 py-3">Content</div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Must specify color -->
<div class="border border-gray-200 px-2 py-3">Content</div>
```

**Global Override** (for backward compatibility):
```css
@layer base {
  *, ::after, ::before, ::backdrop, ::file-selector-button {
    border-color: var(--color-gray-200, currentColor);
  }
}
```

---

## 2.2 Advanced Pattern Changes

### Arbitrary Values Syntax Evolution

**CSS Variable Shorthand Migration**:

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - Square brackets for CSS variables -->
<div class="bg-[--brand-color] w-[--custom-width]"></div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Parentheses for CSS variables -->
<div class="bg-(--brand-color) w-(--custom-width)"></div>
```

**Dynamic Values with @theme**:
```css
@theme {
  --dynamic-width: 200px;
  --dynamic-color: #ff0000;
}
```

```html
<div class="w-[--dynamic-width] bg-[--dynamic-color]">
  Dynamic content
</div>
```

**Grid Arbitrary Values - Comma to Underscore**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<div class="grid-cols-[max-content,auto]"></div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) -->
<div class="grid-cols-[max-content_auto]"></div>
```

### Container Configuration Migration

**v3.4 Approach (JavaScript Config)**:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '2rem',
    }
  }
}
```

**v4.0 Approach (CSS Utility)**:
```css
@utility container {
  margin-inline: auto;
  padding-inline: 2rem;
}
```

**Container Queries - Now Built-In**:
```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 @sm:grid-cols-3 @lg:grid-cols-4">
    <!-- Responsive to container, not viewport -->
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Max-width queries -->
<div class="@container">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-3 @max-md:grid-cols-1">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Range queries -->
<div class="@container">
  <div class="flex @min-md:@max-xl:hidden">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Custom Utilities Registration

**Critical Change**: `@layer utilities` → `@utility` directive

**v3.4 Approach**:
```css
@layer utilities {
  .tab-4 {
    tab-size: 4;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .btn {
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
    background-color: ButtonFace;
  }
}
```

**v4.0 Approach**:
```css
@utility tab-4 {
  tab-size: 4;
}

@utility btn {
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  background-color: ButtonFace;
}
```

### Variant Stacking Order Reversal

**Left-to-Right Application** (reversed from v3):

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - Right to left -->
<ul class="py-4 first:*:pt-0 last:*:pb-0">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
</ul>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Left to right -->
<ul class="py-4 *:first:pt-0 *:last:pb-0">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

### Important Modifier Syntax

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - After variants, before utility -->
<div class="flex! bg-red-500! hover:bg-red-600/50!"></div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - At end of class name -->
<div class="flex bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600/50 !flex !bg-red-500 !hover:bg-red-600/50"></div>
```

Note: The old syntax still works but is deprecated.

### Prefix Syntax Changes

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - Prefix in middle -->
<div class="tw-flex tw-bg-red-500 hover:tw-bg-red-600"></div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Prefix as variant at beginning -->
<div class="tw:flex tw:bg-red-500 tw:hover:bg-red-600"></div>
```

**CSS Variables Include Prefix**:
```css
@import "tailwindcss" prefix(tw);

@theme {
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
}

/* Generates */
:root {
  --tw-color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
}
```

## 2.3 Behavioral & Performance Changes

### Space & Divide Utilities Performance Fix

**Critical Selector Change**:

```css
/* BEFORE (v3) - Performance issues on large pages */
.space-y-4 > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden]) {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

/* AFTER (v4) - Optimized selector */
.space-y-4 > :not(:last-child) {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

**Migration Recommendation**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<div class="space-y-4 p-4">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
</div>

<!-- RECOMMENDED (v4) -->
<div class="flex flex-col gap-4 p-4">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
</div>
```

### Transform Properties Decomposition

**Individual Property Based**:

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - transform property -->
<button class="scale-150 focus:transform-none"></button>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Individual properties -->
<button class="scale-150 focus:scale-none"></button>
```

**Transition Property Updates**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) -->
<button class="transition-[opacity,transform] hover:scale-150"></button>

<!-- AFTER (v4) -->
<button class="transition-[opacity,scale] hover:scale-150"></button>
```

### Hover Variant Media Query Behavior

**New Hover Detection**:
```css
/* v4.0 - Only applies when primary input supports hover */
@media (hover: hover) {
  .hover\:underline:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

**Override for Touch Compatibility**:
```css
@custom-variant hover (&:hover);
```

### Hidden Attribute Priority

**Display Classes No Longer Override `hidden`**:

```html
<!-- BEFORE (v3) - flex would show element -->
<div hidden class="flex">Still hidden in v4</div>

<!-- AFTER (v4) - Remove hidden to show -->
<div class="flex">Now visible</div>
```

Exception: `hidden="until-found"` still works.

### Transition Property Additions

```css
/* v4.0 adds outline-color to transitions */
.transition,
.transition-colors {
  /* Now includes outline-color */
}
```

**Fix for Outline Transitions**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE - Color transitions from default -->
<button class="transition hover:outline-2 hover:outline-cyan-500"></button>

<!-- AFTER - Set color unconditionally -->
<button class="outline-cyan-500 transition hover:outline-2"></button>
```

## 2.4 Modern CSS Features & New Utilities

### Dynamic Utility Values

**Spacing Scale Dynamic Values**:

```html
<!-- No configuration needed -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-15"><!-- Any number --></div>
<div class="w-17"><!-- Any spacing value --></div>
<div class="mt-29 pr-93"><!-- Unlimited --></div>
```

**Data Attribute Variants**:

```html
<div data-current class="opacity-75 data-current:opacity-100">
  Active item
</div>
```

### New Modern Utilities

| **Utility** | **Feature** | **Use Case** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `inset-shadow-*` | Stacked shadows | Up to 4 shadow layers |

| `translate-z-*` | 3D translation | Z-axis movement |

### New Variants

| **Variant** | **Syntax** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `starting` | `starting:opacity-0` | Entry transitions |
| `not-*` | `not-hover:opacity-75` | Negation pseudo-class |
| `not-*` (media) | `not-supports-*:px-4` | Negate feature queries |
| `inert` | `inert:opacity-50` | Non-interactive elements |
| `nth-*` | `nth-3:bg-blue-500` | Nth-child selection |
| `in-*` | `in-*:opacity-100` | Like group without `.group` |
| `@min-*` | `@min-md:grid-cols-3` | Container min-width |
| `@max-*` | `@max-md:grid-cols-1` | Container max-width |

# PART 3: MOBILE NAVIGATION PATTERNS

## 3.1 Core Principles for Mobile Navigation

### Definition of "Nav Disappears"

A mobile navigation is considered "disappeared" when **any** of these are true:

- The user has **no visible navigation affordance** (no links, no menu button, no drawer)
- The nav exists but is **not visible** (hidden by CSS or Tailwind classes)
- The nav is visible but **not interactive** (covered by another layer or z-index issue)
- The nav is interactive but **not reachable by keyboard**

### Success Criteria

A correct mobile nav implementation must satisfy:

- **Discoverability**: Clear affordance (links or menu button) at mobile breakpoints
- **Reachability**: Can be opened and navigated with touch and keyboard
- **Resilience**: Resize/orientation changes do not strand the nav in a broken state
- **No Clipping**: All items remain reachable on small-height screens

---

## 3.2 Non-Negotiable Guardrails

### Viewport Meta is Mandatory

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Without it, breakpoints may not behave as expected on real devices.

### Never Destroy Navigation Without Substitution

**Forbidden Pattern**:
- A mobile media query sets `.nav` / `.nav-links` to `display: none`
- There is **no mobile replacement** (menu button + overlay/drawer)

If you hide desktop nav on mobile, you must introduce a mobile pattern:
- **Menu button** + overlay/drawer
- Or keep inline nav visible (small, stacked)

### Symmetrical Breakpoint Strategy (Tailwind v4)

```tsx
// Desktop nav: visible at md and above
<nav className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-8">...</nav>

// Mobile trigger: hidden at md and above
<button className="md:hidden" aria-label="Open menu">Menu</button>
```

This ensures exactly one navigation pattern is visible at any viewport width.

### Use Semantic Controls for Interactive Toggles

- Use a real `<button type="button">` for opening/closing the menu
- Avoid checkbox/label hacks when accessibility matters
- Include proper ARIA attributes: `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`

### Mobile Overlays Must Not Be Clipped

If an overlay menu is used:
- It must be `position: fixed` (or otherwise outside clipping ancestors)
- It must not be inside a container with `overflow: hidden` unless intentional
- It should support `overflow-y: auto` for small-height devices

### Establish a Z-Index Scale

Random `z-index` values cause "exists but behind something" failures.

Define a scale:
```css
:root {
  --z-base: 0;
  --z-dropdown: 200;
  --z-sticky: 300;
  --z-modal: 400;
  --z-popover: 500;
  --z-tooltip: 600;
}
```

Use the scale consistently across the codebase.

---

## 3.3 Vanilla HTML Implementation

### HTML Structure (Semantic Toggle)

```html
<header class="header">
  <a class="logo" href="#">Brand</a>

  <button
    type="button"
    class="menu-trigger"
    aria-controls="main-navigation"
    aria-expanded="false"
    aria-label="Open navigation"
  >
    <span class="sr-only">Menu</span>
    <span class="icon-hamburger"></span>
  </button>

  <nav id="main-navigation" class="nav-links" aria-label="Main navigation">
    <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>
    <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
    <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

### CSS (Mobile Overlay Pattern)

```css
.menu-trigger { display: none; }

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .menu-trigger { display: inline-flex; }

  body.menu-open { overflow: hidden; }

  .nav-links {
    position: fixed;
    inset: 0;
    top: var(--nav-height, 64px);

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;

    padding: 64px 24px;
    gap: 16px;

    overflow-y: auto;

    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transform: translateY(10px);
    transition: opacity 200ms ease, transform 200ms ease, visibility 200ms ease;

    z-index: var(--z-modal, 400);
    background: #fff;
  }

  body.menu-open .nav-links {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### JavaScript (Minimal State Machine)

```js
(() => {
  const body = document.body;
  const button = document.querySelector('.menu-trigger');
  const nav = document.getElementById('main-navigation');

  if (!button || !nav) return;

  const setMenuState = (open, { focus = true } = {}) => {
    if (open) {
      body.classList.add('menu-open');
      button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
      button.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Close navigation');
      if (focus) {
        const first = nav.querySelector('a');
        if (first) first.focus();
      }
      return;
    }

    body.classList.remove('menu-open');
    button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
    button.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Open navigation');
    if (focus) button.focus();
  };

  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    setMenuState(!body.classList.contains('menu-open'));
  });

  nav.querySelectorAll('a').forEach((a) => {
    a.addEventListener('click', () => setMenuState(false, { focus: false }));
  });

  document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Escape' && body.classList.contains('menu-open')) {
      setMenuState(false);
    }
  });

  window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    if (window.innerWidth > 768 && body.classList.contains('menu-open')) {
      setMenuState(false, { focus: false });
    }
  });
})();
```

## 3.4 React + shadcn/ui Implementation

### Data Model (Single Source of Truth)

```ts
export const NAV_ITEMS = [
  { href: "#collections", label: "Collections" },
  { href: "#showcase", label: "Artisanal Range" },
  { href: "#about", label: "Our Story" },
  { href: "/journal", label: "Journal" },
] as const;
```

### Mobile Navigation with Sheet

```tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";
import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Sheet,
  SheetClose,
  SheetContent,
  SheetHeader,
  SheetTitle,
  SheetTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/sheet";

import { NAV_ITEMS } from "./nav-items";

export function MobileNavSheet() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const pathname = usePathname();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Close on route change to prevent stranded overlays
    setOpen(false);
  }, [pathname]);

  return (
    <Sheet open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <SheetTrigger asChild>
        <Button
          variant="outline"
          size="icon"
          className="md:hidden"
          aria-label={open ? "Close navigation" : "Open navigation"}
        >
          <span className="sr-only">Menu</span>
          <span className="h-5 w-5">≡</span>
        </Button>
      </SheetTrigger>

      <SheetContent side="right" className="p-0">
        <div className="flex h-full flex-col">
          <SheetHeader className="border-b px-6 py-4">
            <SheetTitle>Navigation</SheetTitle>
          </SheetHeader>

          <nav className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto px-6 py-6">
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-3">
              {NAV_ITEMS.map((item) => (
                <li key={item.href}>
                  <SheetClose asChild>
                    <Link
                      href={item.href}
                      className="block rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-lg font-medium leading-tight hover:bg-muted focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring"
                    >
                      {item.label}
                    </Link>
                  </SheetClose>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </nav>
        </div>
      </SheetContent>
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### Desktop Navigation

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { NAV_ITEMS } from "./nav-items";

export function DesktopNav() {
  return (
    <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-8">
      {NAV_ITEMS.map((item) => (
        <Link
          key={item.href}
          href={item.href}
          className="text-sm font-medium hover:underline underline-offset-8"
        >
          {item.label}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

### Complete Header Component

```tsx
import { MobileNavSheet } from "./mobile-nav-sheet";
import { DesktopNav } from "./desktop-nav";

export function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="sticky top-0 z-50 w-full border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-background/60">
      <div className="container flex h-16 items-center justify-between">
        <a href="/" className="text-xl font-bold">
          Brand
        </a>
        
        <DesktopNav />
        <MobileNavSheet />
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}
```

## 3.5 Root-Cause Taxonomy (Mobile Nav Failures)

### Class A — Destructive Hiding Without Substitution

**Signature**:
- `@media (...) { .nav-links { display: none } }`
- No menu trigger exists in DOM

**Fix**:
- Add a mobile trigger + mobile nav presentation (overlay/drawer)

### Class B — Hidden by Visibility/Opacity/Transform State

**Signature**:
- `opacity: 0`, `visibility: hidden`, or transform moves it off-screen
- Open state never activates (CSS state missing or JS not toggling)

**Fix**:
- Verify state toggling logic and selectors
- Ensure open state actually changes computed styles

### Class C — Clipped by Overflow or Layout Constraints

**Signature**:
- Nav exists and is "open" but top items are missing
- Parent has `overflow: hidden`, or overlay is centered and items clip off-screen

**Fix**:
- Use `position: fixed` overlay
- Use `justify-content: flex-start` + `overflow-y: auto`

### Class D — Behind Another Layer (Z-Index/Stacking Context)

**Signature**:
- Nav is present and visible in DOM, but cannot be clicked
- Another element overlays it

**Fix**:
- Raise nav layer using the z-index scale
- Remove accidental stacking contexts (e.g., `transform` on parents)

### Class E — Breakpoint/Viewport Mismatch

**Signature**:
- Works in desktop devtools but fails on real device
- Breakpoints not triggering

**Fix**:
- Ensure viewport meta
- Verify media query units and breakpoint values

### Class F — JavaScript State Bug

**Signature**:
- Menu button exists but does nothing
- Console errors, selector mismatches, timing issues

**Fix**:
- Guard selectors, attach listeners after DOM ready
- Implement a single `setMenuState(isOpen)` function

### Class G — Keyboard-Only Failure

**Signature**:
- Mouse/touch can open
- Keyboard can't reach the trigger or links

**Fix**:
- Ensure trigger is a `<button>`
- Provide visible focus states
- Support Escape-to-close and focus return

### Class H — Click-Outside Handler Race Condition

**Signature** (React-specific):
- Menu briefly opens then immediately closes (or never visibly opens)
- Click on trigger sets state true, but document listener sets it false
- `aria-expanded` may flicker or stay false
- Console logs show state toggling true→false in rapid succession

**Root Cause**:
Document-level click handlers fire after component handlers due to event bubbling. If the click-outside logic doesn't exclude the trigger element, it immediately undoes the toggle.

**Problematic Pattern**:
```tsx
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (!menuElement.contains(e.target)) {
    setIsOpen(false); // Fires when toggle button is clicked!
  }
});
```

**Fix**:
```tsx
const handleClickOutside = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
  const menu = document.getElementById('mobile-menu');
  const trigger = document.querySelector('.menu-toggle');
  
  // Check BOTH menu AND trigger
  if (menu && !menu.contains(target) && !trigger?.contains(target)) {
    setIsOpen(false);
  }
};
```

# PART 4: VISUAL DEBUGGING PLAYBOOK

## 4.1 The "Flat" & "Minimal" Look

### Cause 1: Tailwind Configuration Conflict (v3 vs v4)

**Issue**: Project contains both legacy `tailwind.config.ts` (JS-based v3 config) and modern `tokens.css` (CSS-based v4 config).

**Impact**: Build system prioritizes JS config, which doesn't contain custom color/spacing tokens defined in CSS. Results in undefined classes.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check for legacy config files
ls -la tailwind.config.*
ls -la postcss.config.*

# Check package.json for tailwind version
npm list tailwindcss
```

**Resolution**:
1. Rename `tailwind.config.ts` to `.bak` or delete it
2. Ensure `globals.css` starts with `@import "tailwindcss";`
3. Define all design tokens in `@theme` directive

### Cause 2: Missing Tailwind Entry Point

**Issue**: Global CSS file lacks critical `@import "tailwindcss";` directive.

**Impact**: Tailwind v4.0 does **not generate any utility classes**.

**Diagnosis**:
- Inspect `globals.css` or main CSS entry point
- Verify `@import "tailwindcss";` is present and at the top

**Resolution**:
```css
/* globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  /* Your theme variables here */
}
```

---

## 4.2 Navigation Layout & Visibility Failures

### Cause 3: Variable Naming Mismatch

**Issue**: Design system defines spacing variables as `--spacing-1`, but application code references `var(--space-1)`.

**Impact**: Browsers treat `gap: var(--space-8)` as `gap: unset` (effectively 0), causing elements to crowd together.

**Diagnosis**:
- Open DevTools → Elements
- Select affected element
- Check Computed styles for `gap`, `margin`, `padding`
- Look for `unset` or `0` values where non-zero expected
- Check Styles panel for variable reference warnings

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Global Find & Replace across src directory
# Replace: var(--space-
# With: var(--spacing-

rg "var\(--space-" --type tsx --type ts --type css
```

### Cause 4: Invalid CSS Syntax (Double Wrapping)

**Issue**: Inline styles wrap CSS variables that already contain color values:

```tsx
// Problematic
background: 'rgb(var(--color-espresso-dark))'

// The variable already contains rgb(61 43 31)
// Result: background: rgb(rgb(61 43 31)) - INVALID CSS
```

**Impact**: Invalid CSS causes element to appear transparent.

**Diagnosis**:
- Inspect element with missing background
- Check Styles panel for crossed-out properties
- Look for "invalid CSS" warnings

**Resolution**:
```tsx
// Correct
background: 'var(--color-espresso-dark)'
// or
backgroundColor: 'var(--color-espresso-dark)'
```

---

## 4.3 Hydration & Runtime Errors

### Cause 5: Invalid HTML/SVG Nesting

**Issue**: Animation components return HTML `<div>` elements but are used inside SVG illustrations.

**Impact**: `<div>` cannot be child of `<svg>` or `<g>`. Causes React Hydration Error.

**Diagnosis**:
- Console shows "Hydration failed because initial UI does not match"
- Error mentions "did not match" between server and client

**Resolution**:
Refactor SVG-compatible elements:
```tsx
// Instead of
function SteamRise() {
  return <div className="steam">...</div>;
}

// Use SVG primitives
function SteamRise() {
  return <g className="steam">...</g>;
}
```

---

## 4.4 Tailwind Build/Purge Issues

### Cause 6: Dynamic Class Strings Not Statically Analyzable

**Issue**: Tailwind v4 (like v3) scans for class strings to generate CSS. Dynamic concatenation defeats this:

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC - Tailwind cannot detect this
const size = isMobile ? 'md:hidden' : 'md:flex';
<div className={size}>...</div>

// PROBLEMATIC - Same issue
<div className={"md:" + variant}>...</div>
```

**Impact**: Works in dev, disappears in production (purged).

**Diagnosis**:
- Verify `globals.css` includes proper `@source` directives
- Check build output for missing utility classes
- Reproduce in production build (not just dev server)

**Resolution**:
```tsx
// Static class strings
{isMobile ? (
  <div className="md:hidden">Mobile view</div>
) : (
  <div className="md:flex">Desktop view</div>
)}
```

Or use `@layer` approach for dynamic values:
```css
@theme {
  --breakpoint-mobile: 768px;
}

@media (width < var(--breakpoint-mobile)) {
  .mobile-only {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

---

## 4.5 Diagnostic Decision Tree

### Step 1: Is the nav present in the DOM?

- Inspect Elements
- Search for `<nav` or `.nav-links`

If **not present**: Class A or template omission

If **present**: Continue

### Step 2: Is it hidden by computed CSS?

Check in Computed styles:
- `display` - look for `none`
- `visibility` - look for `hidden`
- `opacity` - look for `0`

If `display: none`: Find the rule (likely mobile media query)

### Step 3: Is it off-screen or clipped?

Check layout box:
- `position`
- `top/left/right/bottom`
- `transform`
- Any ancestor `overflow: hidden`

### Step 4: Is it behind another layer?

If it looks "open" but clicks fail:
- Temporarily toggle `pointer-events: none` on suspected overlays
- Inspect stacking contexts:
  - Any parent with `transform`, `filter`, `opacity < 1`, `position` + `z-index`

### Step 5: Is JS failing to toggle state?

- Check Console for errors
- Verify click handler is attached
- Verify state change occurs (body class or attribute)

### Step 6: Production-only disappearance?

- Check build config: content globs and class string patterns
- Verify no dynamic class concatenation
- Test production build locally

# PART 5: ANTI-PATTERNS CATALOG & PITFALLS

## 5.1 Tailwind v4 Migration Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: @apply Breaks in v4.0.8+

**Issue**: `@apply` directive not working in certain contexts.

**Root Causes**:
- Lightning CSS compatibility issues
- CSS module isolation
- Missing `@reference` directive

**Solution**:
```css
/* In scoped styles (CSS Modules, Vue SFC, etc.) */
@reference "../../app.css";

.my-component {
  @apply flex items-center gap-4;
}
```

### Pitfall 2: @source Breaking in Monorepos

**Issue**: Internal package imports fail.

**Solution**:
```css
/* apps/web/src/style.css */
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import '@repo/tailwind-config/style.css';
@source '../../../tools/tailwind';
```

### Pitfall 3: Arbitrary Values Not Recognized

**Issue**: Dynamic arbitrary values fail.

**Root Cause**: v4 requires predefined values in `@theme` for arbitrary value support in some contexts.

**Solution**:
```css
@theme {
  --dynamic-width: 200px;
  --dynamic-color: #ff0000;
}
```

```html
<div class="w-[--dynamic-width] bg-[--dynamic-color]">
```

### Pitfall 4: Color Opacity Rendering Differences

**Issue**: Subtle color rendering differences between v3 and v4.

**Cause**: v4 uses `color-mix()` internally instead of CSS custom properties for some opacity transformations.

**Mitigation**: Test color values in target browsers, especially with `currentColor`.

### Pitfall 5: Build Time Regression

**Issue**: Builds slower than v3.

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check for misconfigured `@source` scanning large directories
2. Verify Vite plugin vs PostCSS plugin usage
3. Check for content detection scanning `node_modules`

**Solution**:
```css
/* Limit scanning scope */
@source "src/components";
/* NOT @source "." or @source "node_modules"; */
```

### Pitfall 6: Gradient Variables Incompatibility

**Issue**: v3 and v4 gradient variables conflict.

**Cause**: `--tw-gradient-from` format changed.

**Solution**: Full migration required - no mixing v3/v4 in same project.

## 5.2 Mobile Navigation Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: "Hide Nav on Mobile" Without Menu Trigger

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .nav-links { display: none; }
}
```

Creates navigation dead-end. Mobile users have no way to access navigation.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Random Z-Index Escalation

```css
.nav { z-index: 999999; }
```

Hides architectural problems and creates new ones. Establish and use a z-index scale.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Overlay Inside `overflow: hidden` Container

Overlays should be `position: fixed` or guaranteed not to be clipped. Parent containers with `overflow: hidden` create clipping contexts.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Non-Semantic Clickable Divs

```tsx
<div onClick={toggleMenu}>Menu</div>
```

Creates invisible navigation for keyboard users. Use `<button type="button">`.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Missing Mobile Trigger at Correct Breakpoint

```tsx
// Desktop nav hidden on mobile
<nav className="hidden md:flex">...</nav>

// Mobile trigger ALSO hidden on mobile
<button className="hidden md:inline-flex">Menu</button>
```

Result: Nothing is visible on mobile.

### Anti-Pattern 6: SSR/Hydration Conditional Nav

```tsx
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768; // breaks on SSR
return isMobile ? <MobileNav/> : <DesktopNav/>;
```

Results in flicker, hydration mismatch, or missing nav.

### Anti-Pattern 7: Click-Outside Closes Toggle Button Clicks

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    if (!menuRef.current?.contains(e.target as Node)) {
      setIsOpen(false); // Closes even when toggle was clicked!
    }
  };
  document.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
}, []);
```

# PART 6: VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS

## 6.1 Responsive Test Matrix

Test these viewport sizes:

| Width | Height | Device Type |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 360 | 640 | Small phone |
| 390 | 844 | iPhone 14 |
| 430 | 932 | iPhone 14 Pro Max |
| 768 | 1024 | Tablet portrait |
| 1024 | 768 | Tablet landscape / Small desktop |
| 1440 | 900 | Desktop |
| 1920 | 1080 | Large desktop |

**Additional Tests**:
- Small height scenarios (360×640)
- Orientation change (portrait/landscape)
- Reduced motion (OS setting)
- iOS Safari scrolling inside overlays

## 6.2 Keyboard Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Tab reaches the menu button
- [ ] Enter/Space opens the menu
- [ ] Focus moves into menu
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate menu items
- [ ] Escape closes the menu
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger after close
- [ ] Visible focus ring on all interactive elements

## 6.3 Behavior Checklist

- [ ] Menu opens and closes reliably
- [ ] Clicking a link closes the menu
- [ ] Resizing to desktop closes the menu
- [ ] No background scroll bleed when open (scroll lock)
- [ ] Route change closes mobile menu (React)
- [ ] Animation transitions are smooth (check reduced motion)

## 6.4 Styling/Utility Checklist

- [ ] Trigger visible on mobile (`md:hidden`)
- [ ] Desktop links hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`)
- [ ] No purge issues (classes present in production build)
- [ ] Menu isn't clipped: top items visible
- [ ] Menu isn't behind header/hero layers
- [ ] Focus ring visible on links and trigger

## 6.5 Production Build Validation

```bash
# 1. Run production build
npm run build

# 2. Inspect generated CSS
cat dist/app.css | head -100

# 3. Verify expected utilities are present
grep -o "\.bg-[a-z0-9/-]*" dist/app.css | sort | uniq

# 4. Check for purge warnings
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i "purge\|unused\|warn"

# 5. Test in production mode locally
npm run start
```

---

# PART 7: AI AGENT IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

## 7.1 Version Detection Rules

```javascript
// AI Agent Detection Logic
function detectTailwindVersion(file) {
  if (file.includes('@tailwind base')) {
    return { version: 'v3', suggestUpgrade: true };
  }
  if (file.includes('@import "tailwindcss"')) {
    return { version: 'v4', suggestUpgrade: false };
  }
  if (file.includes('tailwind.config.js') || file.includes('tailwind.config.ts')) {
    return { version: 'v3', configExists: true };
  }
  return { version: 'unknown' };
}
```

## 7.2 Systematic Replacement Map

```javascript
// Utility Transformation Map
const v3ToV4Map = {
  'bg-opacity-': '/',
  'text-opacity-': '/',
  'border-opacity-': '/',
  'ring-opacity-': '/',
  'placeholder-opacity-': '/',
  'shadow-sm': 'shadow-xs',
  'shadow': 'shadow-sm',
  'bg-gradient-': 'bg-linear-',
  'outline-none': 'outline-hidden',
  'ring"': 'ring-3"',
  'flex-shrink-': 'shrink-',
  'flex-grow-': 'grow-',
  'overflow-ellipsis': 'text-ellipsis',
  'decoration-slice': 'box-decoration-slice',
  'decoration-clone': 'box-decoration-clone',
};

function migrateUtility(className) {
  for (const [v3, v4] of Object.entries(v3ToV4Map)) {
    if (className.includes(v3)) {
      return className.replace(v3, v4);
    }
  }
  return className;
}
```

## 7.3 Color Space Validation

```javascript
// Check for RGB → OKLCH conversion needs
function validateColorValue(colorValue) {
  if (colorValue.startsWith('#') && colorValue.length === 4) {
    return `Consider expanding ${colorValue} to 7 characters for consistency`;
  }
  if (colorValue.startsWith('rgb')) {
    return 'Consider migrating to OKLCH for v4 compatibility';
  }
  return null;
}
```

## 7.4 Component Template: New Tailwind v4 Component

```css
/* filename: component-name.css */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  /* Custom tokens first */
  --color-brand-primary: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-brand-secondary: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);
  --font-heading: "Inter", system-ui;
  --spacing-component: 1.5rem;
  
  /* Animation tokens */
  --animate-slide-up: slide-up 0.3s ease-out;
  
  @keyframes slide-up {
    from {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: translateY(10px);
    }
    to {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: translateY(0);
    }
  }
}

@utility component-container {
  padding: var(--spacing-component);
  background-color: var(--color-brand-primary);
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

@utility component-title {
  font-family: var(--font-heading);
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

## 7.5 Debugging Workflow for AI Agents

### Step 1: Version Validation
```bash
npm list tailwindcss
# Expected: tailwindcss@4.x.x
```

### Step 2: Build Output Analysis
```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o output.css --verbose
```

### Step 3: CSS Variable Inspection (Browser Console)
```javascript
const styles = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);
console.log('--color-brand-500:', styles.getPropertyValue('--color-brand-500'));
console.log('--spacing-4:', styles.getPropertyValue('--spacing-4'));
```

## 2. Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-First Configuration

### 2.1 Critical: No tailwind.config.js

**Tailwind v4 uses CSS-only configuration.** There should be NO `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts` file.

### 2.2 globals.css Structure

```css
/* src/app/globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* ============================================
   THEME CONFIGURATION
   ============================================ */

@theme {
  /* Custom Colors */
  --color-void: #050506;
  --color-void-light: #0a0a0c;
  --color-aurora-cyan: #22d3ee;
  --color-aurora-purple: #a855f7;
  --color-aurora-magenta: #ec4899;
  --color-champagne: #c9b896;
  --color-champagne-dark: #a89776;
  
  /* Typography */
  --font-sans: "Geist", "Inter", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-serif: "Instrument Serif", "Georgia", serif;
  
  /* Extended Spacing */
  --spacing-18: 4.5rem;
  --spacing-88: 22rem;
  
  /* Custom Animations */
  --animate-aurora-slow: aurora-slow 20s ease-in-out infinite;
  --animate-float-slow: float-slow 25s ease-in-out infinite;
  
  @keyframes aurora-slow {
    0%, 100% { transform: translate(0, 0) scale(1); opacity: 0.8; }
    33% { transform: translate(30%, 20%) scale(1.1); opacity: 0.6; }
    66% { transform: translate(-20%, 30%) scale(0.9); opacity: 0.7; }
  }
  
  @keyframes float-slow {
    0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg); }
    50% { transform: translateY(-20px) rotate(5deg); }
  }
}

/* ============================================
   BASE STYLES
   ============================================ */

@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-slate-800;
  }
  
  html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
  
  body {
    @apply bg-void text-slate-100 font-sans antialiased;
  }
  
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    @apply font-serif;
  }
}

/* ============================================
   CUSTOM UTILITIES
   ============================================ */

@layer utilities {
  .text-balance {
    text-wrap: balance;
  }
  
  .glass-panel {
    @apply bg-slate-900/30 backdrop-blur-xl border border-slate-800/50;
  }
  
  .aurora-gradient {
    background: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      var(--color-aurora-cyan) 0%,
      var(--color-aurora-purple) 50%,
      var(--color-aurora-magenta) 100%
    );
  }
}
```

### 2.3 PostCSS Configuration

```javascript
// postcss.config.mjs
export default {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
```

### 2.4 Migration from v3 to v4: Critical Changes

| v3 Utility | v4 Replacement |
|------------|----------------|
| `bg-opacity-*` | `bg-color/*` (e.g., `bg-red-500/50`) |
| `text-opacity-*` | `text-color/*` |
| `shadow-sm` | `shadow-xs` |
| `shadow` | `shadow-sm` |
| `bg-gradient-to-r` | `bg-linear-to-r` |
| `outline-none` | `outline-hidden` |
| `ring` | `ring-3` |
| `flex-shrink-*` | `shrink-*` |
| `flex-grow-*` | `grow-*` |

**CSS Variable Syntax:**
```css
/* v3 */
<div class="bg-[--brand-color]">

/* v4 */
<div class="bg-(--brand-color)">
```

---

## 3. Component Patterns

### 3.1 UI Primitive Pattern (shadcn-style)

```tsx
// src/components/ui/Button.tsx
import { forwardRef, type ButtonHTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-champagne disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-champagne text-void hover:bg-champagne-dark",
        outline: "border border-slate-700 bg-transparent hover:bg-slate-800",
        ghost: "hover:bg-slate-800",
        link: "underline-offset-4 hover:underline text-champagne",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-8 px-3 text-sm",
        lg: "h-12 px-6 text-lg",
        icon: "h-10 w-10",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

export interface ButtonProps
  extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  loading?: boolean;
}

export const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, loading, children, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        ref={ref}
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)}
        disabled={props.disabled || loading}
        {...props}
      >
        {loading ? (
          <>
            <span className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin rounded-full border-2 border-current border-t-transparent" />
            {children}
          </>
        ) : (
          children
        )}
      </button>
    );
  }
);

Button.displayName = "Button";
```

### 3.2 Section Component Pattern

```tsx
// src/components/sections/Hero.tsx
"use client";

import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useReducedMotion } from "@/lib/hooks/useReducedMotion";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";

export function Hero() {
  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <section className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      {/* Background Animation */}
      <motion.div
        initial={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
        transition={{ duration: 1, ease: "easeOut" }}
        className="absolute inset-0 aurora-gradient opacity-20"
      />
      
      {/* Content */}
      <div className="relative z-10 container mx-auto px-4 text-center">
        <motion.h1
          initial={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 }}
          className="text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl font-serif text-white mb-6"
        >
          Beyond First Class
        </motion.h1>
        
        <motion.p
          initial={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}
          className="text-xl text-slate-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8"
        >
          Curated journeys for the world's most discerning travelers
        </motion.p>
        
        <motion.div
          initial={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.6 }}
        >
          <Button size="lg">Begin Your Journey</Button>
        </motion.div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### 3.3 Form Component Pattern

```tsx
// src/components/ui/Input.tsx
import { forwardRef, type InputHTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

export interface InputProps extends InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {
  label?: string;
  error?: string;
}

export const Input = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, InputProps>(
  ({ className, label, error, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        {label && (
          <label className="text-sm font-medium text-slate-300">
            {label}
            {props.required && <span className="text-aurora-magenta ml-1">*</span>}
          </label>
        )}
        <input
          ref={ref}
          className={cn(
            "flex h-10 w-full rounded-lg border border-slate-700 bg-slate-900/50 px-3 py-2 text-sm text-white placeholder:text-slate-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-champagne focus:border-transparent disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 transition-colors",
            error && "border-aurora-magenta focus:ring-aurora-magenta",
            className
          )}
          {...props}
        />
        {error && (
          <p className="text-sm text-aurora-magenta">{error}</p>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
);

Input.displayName = "Input";
```

### 3.4 useReducedMotion Hook (Required)

```tsx
// src/lib/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export function useReducedMotion(): boolean {
  const [prefersReducedMotion, setPrefersReducedMotion] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)");
    setPrefersReducedMotion(mediaQuery.matches);

    const handler = (event: MediaQueryListEvent) => {
      setPrefersReducedMotion(event.matches);
    };

    mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", handler);
    return () => mediaQuery.removeEventListener("change", handler);
  }, []);

  return prefersReducedMotion;
}
```

## 4. Avant-Garde Design Principles

### 4.1 Anti-Generic Philosophy

Every interface must have a **distinctive conceptual direction**. Reject:
- Bootstrap-style predictable grids
- Safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without typographical hierarchy
- Purple-gradient-on-white clichés
- Predictable card grids and hero sections
- The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

### 4.2 Design Thinking Framework

Before coding, commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

| Direction | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Brutally Minimal** | Extreme whitespace, single focal point |
| **Maximalist Chaos** | Layered textures, bold typography |
| **Retro-Futuristic** | Neon, chrome, geometric patterns |
| **Organic/Natural** | Soft curves, earthy tones, fluid shapes |
| **Luxury/Refined** | Serif fonts, gold accents, subtle gradients |
| **Editorial/Magazine** | Asymmetric layouts, bold headlines |
| **Brutalist/Raw** | Exposed structure, monospace, high contrast |
| **Art Deco/Geometric** | Symmetry, gold/black, stepped forms |

### 4.3 Intentional Minimalism

- **Whitespace is structural**, not just empty space
- **Every element earns its place** through calculated purpose
- If you cannot justify an element's existence, delete it
- **Typography hierarchy** speaks louder than decoration

### 4.4 Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Analyze every design decision through:
1. **Psychological**: User sentiment and cognitive load
2. **Technical**: Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA strictness
4. **Scalability**: Long-term maintenance and modularity

### 4.5 Animation Guidelines

```typescript
// Timing
const ANIMATION_DURATION = {
  instant: 0,      // State changes
  fast: 150,       // Micro-interactions
  normal: 300,     // Standard transitions
  slow: 500,       // Page transitions
  dramatic: 800,   // Hero animations
};

// Easing
const EASING = {
  entrance: [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1],  // Decelerate
  exit: [0.4, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0],    // Accelerate
  standard: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1],  // Symmetric
};

// Stagger
const STAGGER_DELAY = 50; // ms between items
```

## 5. Code Review Protocol

### 5.1 Pre-Review Checklist

Before any code review or completion claim:

```bash
# TypeScript Check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint
npm run lint

# Tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

### 5.2 Review Categories

#### Critical (Must Fix)
- [ ] No `any` types - use `unknown` instead
- [ ] Proper error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Accessibility: focus states, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- [ ] `useReducedMotion` check for all animations
- [ ] No memory leaks in useEffect (proper cleanup)
- [ ] Form validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] XSS prevention (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization)

#### High Priority
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
- [ ] Early returns, avoid nested conditionals
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
- [ ] Error boundaries for component trees
- [ ] Proper React key usage in lists

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Component composition over inheritance
- [ ] Memoization for expensive computations
- [ ] Image optimization with next/image
- [ ] Proper semantic HTML

### 5.3 Code Review Response Pattern

```
READ → UNDERSTAND → VERIFY → EVALUATE → RESPOND → IMPLEMENT
```

**Rules:**
- No performative agreement ("You're absolutely right!")
- Verify technically before implementing
- If unclear: STOP and ask for clarification
- YAGNI check: grep for usage before adding "proper" features

## 6. Security Audit Protocol

### 6.1 OWASP Top 10 2025 Checklist

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| **A01 Broken Access Control** | IDOR prevention, proper auth checks, SSRF protection |
| **A02 Security Misconfiguration** | Secure headers, no default credentials, error handling |
| **A03 Supply Chain** | Audit dependencies (`npm audit`), lock file integrity |
| **A04 Cryptographic Failures** | bcrypt for passwords, jose for JWT, no hardcoded secrets |
| **A05 Injection** | No SQL injection (use Prisma/ORM), no XSS |
| **A06 Insecure Design** | Input validation, business logic flaws |
| **A07 Authentication Failures** | Session management, MFA, secure cookies |
| **A08 Integrity Failures** | Code signing, dependency verification |
| **A09 Logging & Monitoring** | Security event logging, failed auth attempts |
| **A10 Exceptional Conditions** | Fail-closed, proper error handling |

### 6.2 High-Risk Patterns to Flag

```typescript
// ❌ String concatenation in queries
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId;

// ❌ Dynamic code execution
eval(userInput);
new Function(userInput);

// ❌ Unsafe deserialization
JSON.parse(untrustedData); // Without validation

// ❌ Path traversal
fs.readFile(`./uploads/${userInput}`);

// ❌ Disabled security
fetch(url, { verify: false }); // SSL verification disabled
```

### 6.3 Secret Detection Patterns

| Type | Indicators |
|------|------------|
| API Keys | `api_key`, `apikey`, high entropy strings |
| Tokens | `token`, `bearer`, `jwt` |
| Credentials | `password`, `secret`, `key` |
| Cloud | `AWS_`, `AZURE_`, `GCP_` prefixes |

### 6.4 Next.js Specific Security

```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  // Security headers
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/(.*)",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "X-Frame-Options",
            value: "DENY",
          },
          {
            key: "X-Content-Type-Options",
            value: "nosniff",
          },
          {
            key: "Referrer-Policy",
            value: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
  
  // Image optimization
  images: {
    formats: ["image/avif", "image/webp"],
    remotePatterns: [
      { protocol: "https", hostname: "images.unsplash.com" },
    ],
  },
};
```

## 7. Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Critical Rules (Do First)

1. **Eliminate Waterfalls**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Sequential (slow)
   const user = await getUser();
   const posts = await getPosts(user.id);
   
   // ✅ Parallel (fast)
   const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
     getUser(),
     getPosts(),
   ]);
   ```

2. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Dynamic imports for large components
   const HeavyChart = dynamic(() => import("./HeavyChart"), {
     loading: () => <Skeleton />,
   });
   
   // ✅ Direct imports (avoid barrel files)
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";
   // NOT: import { Button } from "@/components/ui"; (index.ts)
   ```

3. **Server Components by Default**
   ```typescript
   // Server component (default) - no "use client"
   export async function ServerComponent() {
     const data = await fetchData(); // Fetches on server
     return <div>{data}</div>;
   }
   
   // Client component only when needed
   "use client";
   export function ClientComponent() {
     const [state, setState] = useState();
     return <div>{state}</div>;
   }
   ```

### 7.2 Image Optimization

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

// ✅ Optimized images
<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority // Above-fold images
  className="object-cover"
/>;

// ✅ Responsive images
<Image
  src="/photo.jpg"
  alt="Photo"
  fill
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  className="object-cover"
/>
```

### 7.3 Font Optimization

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Geist, Instrument_Serif } from "next/font/google";

const geist = Geist({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-sans",
});

const instrumentSerif = Instrument_Serif({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: "400",
  variable: "--font-serif",
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html className={`${geist.variable} ${instrumentSerif.variable}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## 8. Accessibility Requirements (WCAG AAA)

### 8.1 Mandatory Practices

```tsx
// ✅ Semantic HTML
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<main>
  <section aria-labelledby="features-heading">
    <h2 id="features-heading">Features</h2>
  </section>
</main>

// ✅ Focus management
<button className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-champagne focus-visible:outline-none">
  Click me
</button>

// ✅ ARIA labels for icon buttons
<button aria-label="Close dialog">
  <XIcon />
</button>

// ✅ Form labels
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" aria-required="true" />

// ✅ Error announcements
<div role="alert" className="text-aurora-magenta">
  {errorMessage}
</div>
```

### 8.2 Color Contrast Requirements

| Element | Minimum Ratio |
|---------|---------------|
| Normal text | 4.5:1 |
| Large text (18pt+) | 3:1 |
| UI components | 3:1 |

Test with: [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

### 8.3 Reduced Motion Support

```tsx
"use client";

import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useReducedMotion } from "@/lib/hooks/useReducedMotion";

export function AnimatedCard() {
  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
    >
      Content
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## 9. Mobile Navigation Patterns

### 9.1 Breakpoint Strategy

```tsx
// Desktop nav: visible at md and above
<nav className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-8">...</nav>

// Mobile trigger: hidden at md and above
<button className="md:hidden" aria-label="Open menu">Menu</button>
```

### 9.2 Mobile Navigation with Sheet

```tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";
import { Sheet, SheetContent, SheetTrigger } from "@/components/ui/Sheet";

export function MobileNav() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Sheet open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <SheetTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className="md:hidden">
          <MenuIcon />
        </Button>
      </SheetTrigger>
      
      <SheetContent side="right" className="w-[300px]">
        <nav className="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <Link href="/" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Home</Link>
          <Link href="/about" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>About</Link>
        </nav>
      </SheetContent>
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### 9.3 Common Mobile Nav Failures

| Class | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **A** | No visible nav on mobile | Add mobile trigger + overlay |
| **B** | Hidden by opacity/visibility | Verify state toggling |
| **C** | Clipped by overflow | Use `position: fixed` |
| **D** | Behind another layer | Check z-index scale |
| **E** | Breakpoint mismatch | Verify viewport meta |
| **F** | JavaScript failure | Guard selectors, check console |
| **G** | Keyboard inaccessible | Use real `<button>` elements |
| **H** | Click-outside race | Exclude trigger from handler |

// 2. Third-party
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { z } from "zod";

// 3. Absolute imports (@/)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";
import { useReducedMotion } from "@/lib/hooks/useReducedMotion";

// 4. Relative imports
import { HeroAnimation } from "./HeroAnimation";
```

### 11.3 File Headers
